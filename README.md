# cdevkit - Barebones for your Windows C Development Setup

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS!!! PLEASE LEARN LINUX AND C BEFORE USING THIS!!!

cdevkit is a barebones development enviroment which you can configure to your likings. The terminal (cmder) and the editor (neovim) can be configured. Please note that this setup uses tcc instead of GCC/Clang because tcc is way lighter, faster and has all I need as a casual programmer. You can get GCC/Clang binaries from [winlibs](https://winlibs.com/).

## List of Softwares being used
* [GOW (Linux Commandline Applications)](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow)
* [cmder (Console Emulator)](https://cmder.app/)
* [TCC (C Compiler)](https://bellard.org/tcc/)
* [Neovim (Editor)](http://neovim.io/)

I strongly recommend to checkout these softwares and what they do. If you are totally unaware of cmder and/or neovim, read the documentation in their specific websites. I recommend [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) as the neovim config as it is easy to install and easy to use. 

You can download it in the releases tab.
